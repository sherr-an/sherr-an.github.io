      <h2>About Me</h2> 
      <p>Hi there, my name is Xinyue (Sherry) An, and I am a second-year PhD student in computational neuroscience. I have always been interested in unknown, mysterior things, especially the brain that sits on top of our body as the core of intelligence. Starting my undergrad as a Biology major, I later shifted gear to Neuroscience and found my passion in the elegant fusion between Neuroscience and Computer Science - the studies of the two potent intelligent systems. Because one shall only use a diamond to cut another diamond, to me, artificial intelligence could be the best tool to interpret natural intelligence.</p>   
      <p>Outside of lab, I like to make espresso drinks and cocktails - one to sober, the other to numb. I also enjoy music, podcast, reading, hiking, and skateboarding.</p>

      <p>[2023-] (<em>In Progress</em>) Somatosensory cortex is a specialized brain area that mediates our sense of the body. To maintain an accurate and updated representation of the body state, it is hypothesized that primary somatosensory cortex (S1) receives an "efference copy" signal from the motor cortex about the upcoming movement plan, and an "afferent feedback" signal from the peripheral about the movement effects. My current project seeks to answer: How do those two signals co-exist and interact in the same neuronal population to update the information online?
      </p>
      <p>[2021-22] Deep learning is an emergent theme in the field of computational neuroscience, and the increasing amount of behavioral data in the video form calls for better tools to quantify behaviors. In my honors thesis, I presented a video analysis pipeline that incorporates an animal pose tracking tool and an autoencoder, both deep-learning-based methods, to identify <em>Drosophila</em> behaviors in an unsupervised manner and characterize behavioral effects of descending neuron activation. (advised by Dr. Gordon Berman.)</p>
