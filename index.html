      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi there, my name is Xinyue (Sherry) An, and I am a second-year Neuroscience PhD student at Northwestern Univeristy. I have always been interested in unknown, mysterior things, especially the brain that sits on top of our body as the core of intelligence. Starting my undergrad as a Biology major, I later shifted gear to Neuroscience and found my passion in the elegant fusion between Neuroscience and Computer Science - the studies of the two potent intelligent systems. Because one shall only use a diamond to cut another diamond, to me, artificial intelligence could be the best tool to interpret natural intelligence.</p>   
      <p>Outside of lab, I like to make espresso drinks and cocktails - one to sober, the other to numb. I also enjoy music, podcast, reading, hiking, and skateboarding.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>[2023-] <em>In Progress</em>
      </p>
      <p>[2021-22] In "Using Deep-Learning Based Approaches to Quantify <em>Drosophila</em> Behaviors"</a>, I incorporated an animal pose tracking tool and an autoencoder, both deep-learning based methods, to quantify Drosophila behaviors with joint angles and identify behavioral effects of descending neuron activation. This is my senior honors thesis advised by Dr. Gordon Berman.</p>
